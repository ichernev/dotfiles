## Configuration file for locale-gen
##
## lists of locales that are to be generated by the locale-gen command.
##
## Each line is of the form:
##
##     <locale> <charset>
##
##  where <locale> is one of the locales given in /usr/share/i18n/locales
##  and <charset> is one of the character sets listed in /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
##
##  Examples:
##  en_US ISO-8859-1
##  en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
##  de_DE ISO-8859-1
##  de_DE@euro ISO-8859-15
##
##  The locale-gen command will generate all the locales,
##  placing them in /usr/lib/locale.
##
## This file names the currently supported and somewhat tested locales.
## If you have any additions please file a glibc bug report.
